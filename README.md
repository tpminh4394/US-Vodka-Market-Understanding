# US-Vodka-Market-Understanding
### There is a dataset present marketshare, volumne sale of major vodka brand in US. The goal is to find the impact of different marketing mix to total sale.

As for me, I will examine the impact of the below of the factor on sales:
- Price 
- Quality (Tier 1 or Tier 2) 
- Competition (total sales of competitor, or we could use some sort of market concentration index e.g. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index )
- Marketing mix (expenditure on different marketing medium)
